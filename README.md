## What is matplotlib?
The Matplotlib is a powerful library capable of producing complex publication quality figures with fine layout control in two or three dimensions. While, it's an older library, so many libraries are built on the top of it, and use it's syntax.

One of Matplotlib’s most important features is its ability to play well with many operating systems and graphics backends.
Matplotlib supports dozens of backends and output types, which means you can count on it to work regardless of which operating system you are using or which output format you wish.
This cross-platform, everything-to-everyone approach has been one of the great strengths of Matplotlib.
It has led to a large user base, which in turn has led to an active developer base and Matplotlib’s powerful tools and ubiquity within the scientific Python world.

This repository is specifically focused on understanding and going through Data Visualization using matplotlib.
